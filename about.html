    <b>Hi there i'm Daniel Okon, a web dveloper, Cartoon Animator and Game dveloper with a passion for turning
        ideas into reality through code.</b><br>
    <p>From The First Day I wrote my first "Coding is fun" code with HTML, I develop a passion in coding, as i
        see
        it as an opportunity of turning your imaginations into realities, Althoug it didn't start like that.
        I grew up in a family of 4, never had a chance to play with my peer group. I started coding when my mom
        bought the first computer i used.</p>
    <p>Currently on the path of obtaining my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Ahmadu Bello University, I
        hold some few qualifications in various coding path. over the years, i've dived deep into languages like
        Python,Html,C++, Javascript. constantly expanding my knowledge and staying up-to-date with the latest
        tech trends.</p>
    <p>My experience includes working in both start-up environments and companies, where I've
        collaborated with incredible teams to build robust and user-friendly software solutions. I thrive on
        challenges, whether it's optimizing code for performance or finding elegant solutions to intricate
        problems.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the world of tech blogs, attending various coding lectures
        on Coursera or ALX, or writing romantic stories, not a fan of movies or animes though, but i love
        gaming.</p>
    <p>In this rapidly evolving digital landscape, I believe in the power of technology to make a positive
        impact on people's lives. My goal is to create software that not only functions flawlessly but also
        brings joy and simplicity to its users.</p>
    <p>Through this blog, I hope to share my programming knowledge, insights, and personal projects with you.
        Let's embark on this coding journey together and build something incredible!, <b>I i'm Bright and This
            is my world</b></p>
